# speedvehicle_picamera
 My program is based on the motion detection program found on the pyimagesearch.com site with modifications for speed detection. Not only does the program need to detect motion, it needs to time the moving car as it passes across the cameraâ€™s field of view, and it needs to know how far the car traveled.
